# Package Management Lessons — Distrobox + NVIDIA + Emulators (2026-04)

Historical note: this file is retained as setup background. The current source
of truth for active rebuilds is `README.md` plus the numbered scripts under
`scripts/`.

What we learned about package sources, selection priorities, and gotchas
when building a gaming distrobox container on Arch with an NVIDIA GPU.

---

## Package selection priority

Order of preference when multiple sources exist for the same emulator:

1. **Pacman extras** — first choice. Native Arch packages, auto-update with `pacman -Syu`, smallest footprint, best integration. Used for: retroarch, dolphin-emu, ppsspp, mgba-qt, mednafen, mame, scummvm, desmume, mupen64plus, and all `libretro-*` cores.

2. **AUR `-bin` packages** — preferred for things not in extras. These wrap upstream AppImages or pre-compiled binaries into pacman packages. No compile time, auto-update via `yay -Syu`, AppImage tracks upstream releases. Used for: eden-bin, rpcs3-bin, pcsx2-latest-bin, duckstation-qt-bin, cemu-bin, xemu-bin, vita3k-bin, shadps4-bin.

3. **AUR stable source** (no suffix) — fallback when no `-bin` exists. Source build from a stable release tag. Recompiles on every update but the build is usually deterministic and fast. Used for: flycast, azahar, emulationstation-de, supermodel.

4. **AUR `-git`** — last resort. Tracks `HEAD` of the upstream repo. Recompiles every update, build can break on unstable commits. Only use when no other option exists or when `-bin` is significantly outdated and the upstream doesn't do stable releases.

5. **Flatpak** — see "Flatpak findings" section below. NOT viable inside distrobox.

## NVIDIA in distrobox — the dummy package trick

### The problem

Distrobox `--nvidia` bind-mounts the host's NVIDIA userspace libraries (`/usr/lib/libnvidia-*.so`, `/usr/lib/libGLX_nvidia.so*`, Vulkan ICD jsons, etc.) into the container **read-only**. These files physically exist at the same paths where `nvidia-utils` would install them.

When pacman tries to install any package that depends on `nvidia-utils` (which includes `steam`, `lib32-mesa`, `vulkan-tools`, and transitively half the gaming stack), it sees the bind-mounted files as "file conflicts" and aborts:
```
nvidia-utils: /usr/lib/libnvidia-glcore.so.595.58.03 exists in filesystem
```

### Workaround 1: --assume-installed (per-command, not sticky)

```bash
sudo pacman -S --assume-installed nvidia-utils=595.58.03-1 <packages>
```

This tells pacman "pretend nvidia-utils is installed at this version" for dependency resolution. Works for direct `pacman -S` calls but is NOT sticky — you must pass it every single time. And it **does NOT work for yay/makepkg** because makepkg calls pacman internally and there's no way to propagate `--assume-installed` through yay's `--mflags` (that option passes flags to makepkg, not pacman).

### Workaround 2: Dummy local package (permanent fix)

Build a tiny PKGBUILD that `provides=(nvidia-utils=$VERSION vulkan-driver opengl-driver nvidia-libgl)` and `conflicts=(nvidia-libgl nvidia-utils)`. Install it with `pacman -U`. After this, pacman's dependency resolver sees nvidia-utils as satisfied everywhere — including inside makepkg, which means yay works normally.

```bash
# PKGBUILD for nvidia-utils-dummy
pkgname=nvidia-utils-dummy
pkgver=595.58.03  # must match host nvidia driver version
provides=("nvidia-utils=$pkgver" "vulkan-driver" "opengl-driver" "nvidia-libgl")
conflicts=("nvidia-libgl" "nvidia-utils")
package() { :; }
```

To find the version: `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader` on the host, then append `-1` for the pkgrel.

Check `pacman -Q lib32-nvidia-utils` — on some images it installs successfully (the file conflict is 64-bit only). If it's missing, build a second dummy for `lib32-nvidia-utils-dummy` with the same pattern.

### Steam Runtime 32-bit NVIDIA workaround

`distrobox --nvidia` can also bind host NVIDIA files over `/usr/lib32`. On this
setup, `/usr/lib32/libGLX_nvidia.so.0` appeared as an ELF 64-bit library, which
made 32-bit Proton/DXVK titles fail with:

```text
DxvkInstance::createInstance: Failed to create Vulkan instance
```

The `bootstrap_packages` role keeps the dependency-safe dummy package above,
but also extracts the matching archived `lib32-nvidia-utils` package (or,
when Arch never shipped the host's driver version, e.g. Ubuntu's 580.178.04,
the NVIDIA libs from the `32/` directory of the official
`NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-<ver>.run` installer at `dg_nvidia_run_base_url`; the
bundled glvnd copies are skipped) into:

```text
{{ dg_nvidia_lib32_extract_dir }}/usr/lib32
```

Desktop launchers pass this path as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with only the extracted
lib32 NVIDIA directory. Steam Runtime's `_v2-entry-point` converts that value
into `PRESSURE_VESSEL_APP_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the Proton app container and then
unsets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Do not add broad host paths here: keep it limited to
the extracted lib32 NVIDIA directory, otherwise pressure-vessel helper programs
can pick up incompatible libraries.

### Proper way to fix 32-bit Steam/Proton games on NVIDIA

When an old 32-bit Windows Steam game fails under Proton, do not start by
resetting prefixes, changing Proton versions repeatedly, or adding global Steam
environment variables. Use this order:

1. **Capture evidence first.** Enable a per-game Proton log or inspect the Steam
   logs. The NVIDIA lib32 failure usually includes one of these symptoms:

   ```text
   The NVIDIA driver was unable to open 'libnvidia-glvkspirv.so.<version>'
   DxvkInstance::createInstance: Failed to create Vulkan instance
   wine_vkCreateInstance Failed to create instance
   ```

2. **Verify the container lib32 NVIDIA bind.** In this distrobox, `--nvidia` can
   accidentally place 64-bit NVIDIA libraries under `/usr/lib32`. Check both the
   active bind and the extracted workaround:

   ```sh
   file /usr/lib32/libGLX_nvidia.so.0
   file {{ dg_nvidia_lib32_lib_dir }}/libGLX_nvidia.so.$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader | tr -d '[:space:]')
   file {{ dg_nvidia_lib32_lib_dir }}/libnvidia-glvkspirv.so.$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader | tr -d '[:space:]')
   ```

   The extracted files must be `ELF 32-bit` and must match the active driver
   version. If they are stale, refresh the extracted `lib32-nvidia-utils` package
   before changing game settings.

3. **Apply the fix per game, not globally.** Add the AppID to
   `dg_steam_lib32_nvidia_appids` in
   `ansible/group_vars/all/steam_lib32_nvidia.yml`, and use the default launch
   option unless that game also needs extra arguments:

   ```text
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{ dg_nvidia_steam_runtime_ld_library_path }} %command%
   ```

   Use `dg_steam_lib32_nvidia_launch_options_by_appid` for one-off additions
   such as gamescope or launcher bypass flags. Do **not** put this
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`, or gamescope wrapper on the global
   Steam desktop launcher; Steam's 32-bit updater/client and unrelated games can
   break.

4. **Edit Steam config only while Steam is stopped.** The role refuses live
   edits by default. Run it with the local userdata path after closing Steam, or
   explicitly allow the role to stop Steam:

   ```sh
   ansible-playbook site.yml --tags steam_lib32_nvidia \
     -e dg_steam_lib32_nvidia_localconfig=<Steam userdata>/config/localconfig.vdf
   ```

5. **Only then debug game-specific launchers/configs.** If DXVK now creates a
   device and the game opens or reaches its launcher, remaining failures are
   usually game-specific: missing config files, a .NET launcher, fullscreen
   behavior, controller mapping, or mod tooling. Keep those as separate per-game
   overrides instead of broad Proton/prefix churn.

Older quick checks for this failure are still useful:

```sh
file /usr/lib32/libGLX_nvidia.so.0
grep -i 'DxvkInstance::createInstance' ~/steam-<appid>.log
```

The extracted package version must match the host driver reported by
`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader`.

## Native Steam controller notes

The current 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller path is a host kernel input
device, not something created by the distrobox. In the working XInput mode it
appears as USB `2dc8:310b`, creates `/dev/input/js0`, uses the kernel `xpad`
driver, and also exposes extra keyboard/mouse HID interfaces through `hidraw`.
Steam and native games can therefore disagree about whether they should read the
physical device directly or Steam Input's virtual controller.

### Marvel Cosmic Invasion

Marvel Cosmic Invasion (`2753970`) is a native Linux FNA/SDL3 game. With Steam
Input enabled, Steam loaded a controller profile but the game did not receive a
usable gamepad. Disabling Steam Input for the game fixed detection. Keep this as
the known-good baseline for this title unless a future Steam Input update
changes the behavior.

### Unity 6 games fail silently under proton-cachyos

Super Woden: Rally Edge (`3218630`) stopped launching after
proton-cachyos became the account-wide default (2026-06-13): instant
death, no window, no Unity `Player.log`. `PROTON_LOG=1` showed the
loader failing with `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` (`c0000135`):

```
err:module:import_dll Library UIAutomationCore.DLL
    (which is needed by UnityPlayer.dll) not found
```

Unity 6 (`6000.x`) links `UnityPlayer.dll` against `UIAutomationCore.DLL`.
The proton-cachyos build ships only the prefix stub copies of that DLL —
the real PE is missing from its `files/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/`
(packaging trim). Valve Proton ships it.

**Fix**: per-app CompatToolMapping to a Valve Proton (`proton_11`), same
pattern as FFVII.

**Follow-up (2026-07-03)**: this plus general instability tipped the
decision to revert the account-wide default (`"0"` mapping) back to
Valve `proton_11`. proton-cachyos remains per-app-pinned ONLY where it
earned its keep: FH6 (`2483190`), art of rally (`550320`), and `985890`.
If another title misbehaves under cachyos, flip that one pin — the
default no longer spreads the risk to every game.

### art of rally: use the Windows build under Proton

art of rally (`550320`) controller input is RESOLVED (2026-07-02): force the
Windows build under Proton (`proton-cachyos` via CompatToolMapping). The
native Linux Unity/Rewired build never recognizes gamepads on this stack.
Evidence gathered during the failed native attempts, kept so nobody repeats
them:

- Steam sees the 8BitDo controller and can load either Art's controller profile
  or `controller_base/empty.vdf` when Steam Input is disabled.
- Marvel detects the same controller with Steam Input disabled, so the basic
  `/dev/input` and `hidraw` permissions are not the blocker.
- Art's `Player.log` has no useful Rewired, controller, Steam Input, or libudev
  diagnostics.
- Clearing `RewiredSaveData_ControllerAssignments` caused Art to regenerate a
  clean prefs file, but it still did not create a new joystick assignment or
  detect input.
- Earlier Art-only changes did not fix input: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib`, a
  copied `libudev.so`, and a custom `libudev.so` shim that removed missing
  `udev_*W` log errors.

The native Linux input stack is a dead end: ProtonDB and the game's Steam
community consensus is that native Rewired detects controllers but marks
them "Is Recognized: No", and the fix is running the Windows build under
Proton (which reportedly also roughly doubles the framerate). The ZSA
Moonlander was ruled out as an interference source: it exposes only
keyboard/mouse/consumer-control interfaces, no joystick-class device.

Switched to the Windows build on 2026-07-02:

- Removed the Art-only leftovers from the failed native experiments: the
  `artofrally_Data/Mono/libudev.so` shim, its backups and note files, and
  the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib %command%` launch option.
- Added a `CompatToolMapping` entry for `550320` in Steam's `config.vdf`
  forcing `proton-cachyos-11.0-20260520-slr-x86_64_v3` (both files edited
  with Steam stopped, with timestamped backups).
- On next Steam start the Windows depot downloads over the install dir.

Confirmed working: the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 (XInput mode) is detected and
playable in the Proton build. Do not resume native Rewired/libudev tweaks;
if the Proton build ever misbehaves, start from Steam Input state and
ProtonDB reports, not from the native stack.

### Sonic Adventure DX notes

Sonic Adventure DX is a 32-bit D3D9 Steam game. It needs the 32-bit NVIDIA
workaround above and should run in windowed mode under Wine/Proton. For the
local 4K display, set the game config to 3840x2160 windowed. Do not wrap SADX in
gamescope: it produced a fullscreen green screen with audio still playing in the
background, the same class of presentation failure seen with some other Wine +
gamescope paths.

If the game crashes after DXVK creates the NVIDIA device, inspect
`Sonic Adventure DX/system_config.xml` and set:

```xml
<adapter ... width="3840" height="2160" refresh="60" ... />
<custom_gfx_options AA="0" v_sync="1" fxaa="1" windowed="1" />
```

The local SADX Steam launch option should be the default 32-bit NVIDIA wrapper,
with no gamescope or extra flags:

```text
LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{ dg_nvidia_steam_runtime_ld_library_path }} %command%
```

The official Steam configure launcher may also require the legacy SEGA uninstall
registry key before it saves configuration.

### Sonic Adventure 2 notes

Sonic Adventure 2 is also a 32-bit D3D9 Steam game, so keep it in the same
per-game 32-bit NVIDIA launch-option list as Sonic Adventure DX, Sonic CD, and
Sonic Mania. Its Steam entry starts the .NET `Launcher.exe`; if Proton shows a
`System.DllNotFoundException` for `UIAutomationCore.dll`, treat that as a
separate launcher issue rather than another NVIDIA runtime failure.

For vanilla SA2, prefer bypassing the launcher instead of installing extra
Windows components into the prefix. Seed these files first:

```text
Sonic Adventure 2/Config/UserConfig.cfg
Sonic Adventure 2/Config/Keyboard.cfg
```

Then launch with `-q` after `%command%`. The local Ansible launch-option
override combines both requirements:

```text
LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{ dg_nvidia_steam_runtime_ld_library_path }} %command% -q
```

Avoid resetting the prefix or installing `.NET`/`uiautomationcore` unless the
stock launcher or SA Mod Manager is specifically required.

### WRC 4 / WRC 5 notes

WRC 4 (`256330`) and WRC 5 (`354160`) are also old 32-bit D3D titles. After
repairing prefixes that contained stale symlinks to removed Proton builds, both
still failed at 32-bit DXVK Vulkan initialization until the same per-game
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{ dg_nvidia_steam_runtime_ld_library_path }} %command%`
workaround was applied.

Keep the NVIDIA lib32 fix per game through `steam_lib32_nvidia`; do not restore a
global Steam `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`, or gamescope wrapper for
these titles.

WRC 4 has a separate display-settings trap: its first-run configuration app can
select a high refresh rate such as 240 Hz. In the tested setup that produced a
black game window with audio still playing behind it. Open the WRC 4 video
settings/configuration app and choose **60 Hz**; the working local config has
`RefreshRate=60`.

## Flatpak findings

### Flatpak inside distrobox: DOES NOT WORK

Tested April 2026. Flatpak's `bwrap` (bubblewrap) sandbox does not nest cleanly inside Docker's mount namespaces:

```
Failed to open runtime files: Bad address
Could not connect: No such file or directory
```

The freedesktop/nvidia **runtimes** download and install fine. Actual **application** installs fail at the bwrap-deploy step. This is a known interaction between flatpak and rootless container engines, not specific to distrobox.

The broken distrobox→host `flatpak` symlink at `/usr/bin/flatpak` (created by distrobox for host delegation) also blocks installing a real flatpak inside the container — must be removed first with `docker exec -u root gaming rm /usr/bin/flatpak`.

### Flatpak on the host: works perfectly

If you want Flathub apps for gaming, install flatpak on the **host** (not in distrobox):
```bash
sudo pacman -S flatpak xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user flathub <app-id>
flatpak override --user --filesystem=/mnt/terachad/Emulators:ro <app-id>
```

This adds exactly ONE package to host pacman (`flatpak`). The actual gaming flatpaks live in `~/.local/share/flatpak/` or `/var/lib/flatpak/`, completely outside pacman. Host setup wasn't taken in our case because AUR `-bin` packages covered everything.

### Flatpak vs AUR version comparison (as of April 2026)

| Emulator | Flathub version | AUR -bin version | Winner |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| PCSX2 | v2.6.3 (very stale — summer 2024) | 2.7.245 via pcsx2-latest-bin | AUR by ~250 commits |
| RPCS3 | 0.0.40-19146 | 0.0.40.19180 via rpcs3-bin | Comparable, AUR slightly newer |
| Azahar | 2124.3 | 2125.0.1 | Comparable, AUR slightly newer |
| Flycast | v2.6 | 2.6 | Same |
| DuckStation | NOT on Flathub | 0.1.r10975 via duckstation-qt-bin | AUR only |
| Eden | NOT on Flathub | 0.1.1 via eden-bin | AUR only |
| ES-DE | NOT on Flathub | 3.4.0 | AUR only |

**Takeaway:** Flathub emulator versions lag behind AUR for several key emulators. PCSX2 on Flathub is especially stale (slow stable release channel). Unless you specifically need the sandboxing flatpak provides, AUR `-bin` is better.

---

## Specific package gotchas

### duckstation — metapackage trap

`duckstation` (AUR) is now a **metapackage** redirecting to `duckstation-gpl`. The GPL fork bumped its build dependency to `clang19`, which in turn pulls `compiler-rt19` + `lld19` from AUR. The `compiler-rt19` package **fails to build** against current GCC due to a `-Werror` + `-Wformat=` warning in `sanitizer_stack_store.cpp`.

**Fix:** Use `duckstation-qt-bin` instead. Pre-compiled AppImage, no clang19 needed.

### pcsx2 — three confusing packages

| Package | Version | What it is |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `pcsx2` | v2.6.3 | Old stable release from 2024. Way behind master. |
| `pcsx2-git` | 2.7.245+ | Tracks git HEAD. Compiles from source (~10 min). Most current code. |
| `pcsx2-latest-bin` | 2.7.245 | AppImage wrapper. **Has `_autoupdate=true`** in PKGBUILD, so yay rebumps the version to current master at build time even though the static `pkgver` field says `2.7.133`. Best of both worlds: latest code, no compile. |

**Use `pcsx2-latest-bin`.** It's the same upstream master as `-git` but as an AppImage.

### rpcs3-bin — llvm19 dep on first install

`rpcs3-bin` is an AppImage wrapper (fast to install) but it depends on `llvm19` (runtime lib). LLVM19 is NOT in the Arch extras repo (extras has LLVM 22), so yay builds it from AUR source. **First install** takes ~15 minutes for the LLVM compile. Subsequent installs use the cached package.

This also pulls `compiler-rt19` → `clang19` → `lld19` as build deps. These can fail if yay doesn't serialize the dependency chain correctly (race condition in parallel builds). **If they fail, just re-run yay** — llvm19 is now installed, so the deps resolve on retry.

### zlib-ng-compat swap

Several AUR `-bin` packages (vita3k-bin, shadps4-bin) depend on `zlib-ng-compat`, a drop-in faster replacement for `zlib`. pacman's `--noconfirm` defaults the destructive "Remove zlib?" prompt to **No**, causing the install to fail silently.

**Fix:** Pre-swap manually:
```bash
yes y | sudo pacman -S zlib-ng-compat
```

### vita3k-bin — ships default config

Unlike most emulators, `vita3k-bin` writes a default `~/.config/Vita3K/config.yml` at package install time (not first launch). If you pre-write a tuned config before installing the package, the package install overwrites it.

**Pattern:** Install first, then apply targeted edits to the default config.

**Update (2026-08):** `vita3k-bin` is currently commented out of the AUR
package list — its upstream PKGBUILD fails to build (it dropped
`org.vita3k.vita3k.metainfo.xml`). It's a known, expected skip until
upstream fixes the PKGBUILD, not a local regression. The bootstrap AUR
install also now tolerates any single broken AUR package instead of
aborting the whole run, so this failure mode no longer blocks the rest
of setup.

### RPCS3 — rejects pre-written YAML

RPCS3's `config.yml` has version-specific key names and structure. If you pre-stage a YAML config that doesn't match RPCS3's expected format exactly, it errors with `Failed to apply global config` and silently ignores it.

**Pattern:** Delete any pre-staged config, run RPCS3 once (headless or GUI) to generate fresh defaults, then apply targeted edits to specific keys (Resolution Scale, Anisotropic Filter, VSync, etc.).

### Historical distrobox-export --app name matching

`distrobox-export --app <name>` greps for `<name>` inside the `Exec=` and `Name=` lines of desktop files in `/usr/share/applications/`. It does **NOT** match against the `.desktop` filename.

| Works | Fails |
|-------|-------|
| `--app retroarch` | `--app com.libretro.RetroArch` |
| `--app duckstation-qt` | `--app org.duckstation.DuckStation` |
| `--app mgba-qt` | `--app io.mgba.mGBA` |

This repo no longer uses `distrobox-export` for managed launchers; Ansible
renders `.desktop` files into `config/desktop/rendered/` and the host-side
`scripts/install-host-launchers.sh` installs them.

### eden.desktop — SPDX comment bug

`eden.desktop` ships with SPDX license comments before the `[Desktop Entry]` section. This confuses `distrobox-export`'s parser, producing a garbage 20-byte file named `gaming-eden` (no `.desktop` extension). The managed launcher renderer avoids that parser entirely.

---

## archlinux:latest container image quirks

Things that differ from a standard Arch install and break common setup guides:

1. **No `[multilib]` section** in `/etc/pacman.conf` — not even commented out. Must be appended manually.
2. **Stray `[options]` at end of pacman.conf** — empty section that absorbs anything appended after it. Delete it before appending `[multilib]`.
3. **Passwordless sudo not configured** — despite distrobox's init running. The shipped `/etc/sudoers.d/sudoers` has wrong permissions (0644 instead of 0440) so sudo silently ignores it, AND the `%wheel` rule has no NOPASSWD. Fix: create `/etc/sudoers.d/zz-*` (zz prefix loads last = wins).
4. **No `flatpak` binary** — distrobox creates a symlink `/usr/bin/flatpak → /usr/bin/distrobox-host-exec` for host delegation. If the host has no flatpak, this is a broken symlink that also blocks installing flatpak inside the container (file conflict on `/usr/bin/flatpak`).
5. **Docker is the container manager** (not podman) on this host. Direct container-root ops use `docker exec -u root gaming <cmd>`.

---

## What's NOT available anywhere

| System/Feature | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| `libretro-beetle-saturn` | Not in extras. Use mednafen standalone or beetle-saturn-git from AUR. |
| `libretro-fbneo` | Not in extras. Use libretro-fbneo-git from AUR. |
| `libretro-stella`, `libretro-bluemsx`, `libretro-handy`, `libretro-prosystem`, `libretro-o2em`, `libretro-mednafen-{ngp,pcfx,saturn}`, `libretro-virtualjaguar`, `libretro-vecx` | None in extras. Use mednafen standalone for covered systems, or AUR -git builds. |
| `melonds` standalone | Not in extras. Only AUR git builds. Use `libretro-melonds` (extras, via RetroArch) or `desmume` standalone (extras). |
| Sega Model 2 emulator | No native Linux emulator at all. Use MAME's partial Model 2 driver, or run the Windows "Sega Model 2 Emulator" via Wine/Lutris. |
| PS4 emulation | Keep `shadps4-bin` installed as a fallback/icon source, but Driveclub now launches through `/mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/bin/shadps4-current`, a wrapper that targets the QtLauncher-managed Pre-release build. |

Driveclub-specific shadPS4 notes:

- Local Driveclub runtime content is now expected as an extracted
  `CUSA00003/` directory under
  `/mnt/terachad/Emulators/EmuDeck/roms_rare/ps4`, with `eboot.bin` inside it.
- shadPS4 runtime state is under
  `/mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/.local/share/shadPS4/`, and the setup mirrors
  `CUSA00003.toml` into `/mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/.config/shadPS4/custom_configs/`
  because current Linux builds do not consistently agree on the game-config path.
- PS4 11.00 firmware modules live in
  `/mnt/terachad/Emulators/EmuDeck/roms_rare/ps4-firmware/11.00_sys_modules`.
  They are symlinked into shadPS4's `sys_modules` directory to avoid duplicating
  ~1.5 GB of firmware files.
- Game-specific config: `custom_configs/CUSA00003.toml`.
- Patch file: `patches/Driveclub.xml`, with the official `60 FPS with deltatime`
  v1.28 patch enabled.
- ES-DE PS4 launcher is Driveclub-specific and points at the extracted game
  boot file:
  `/mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/bin/shadps4-current -g %ROM% -p /mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/.local/share/shadPS4/patches/Driveclub.xml -f true`.
- Current upstream/forum guidance for Linux mainline/nightly is: Driveclub needs
  readbacks enabled, readback linear images disabled, v1.28, 1920x1080 window and
  internal size, and the 60fps deltatime patch. Expect shader/cache warm-up and
  occasional crashes; this title is still experimental.
- Keep the PS4 root clean. Do not leave raw `.pkg` files or Windows extraction
  tools mixed beside the extracted game directory. This shadPS4 build launches
  an installed/dumped game directory or `eboot.bin`.

PS4 PKG tooling notes:

- Working tool: `ShadPKG`, kept under
  `/mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/tools/ShadPKG`.
- Working CLI binary:
  `/mnt/data/distrobox/gaming/tools/ShadPKG/build-cli/shadpkg`.
- Local Linux build worked with `BUILD_GUI=OFF` plus a small local
  `Findcapstone.cmake` helper for Arch.
- `ShadPKG` successfully handled both:
  - `blz-dc.pkg`
  - `Driveclub.v1.28.PATCH.REPACK.PS4-GCMR.pkg`
- `sfo-info`, `pfs-info`, and full `extract` succeeded on both PKGs.
- Comparing extracted base+patch contents against the live
  `/mnt/terachad/Emulators/EmuDeck/roms_rare/ps4/CUSA00003` tree showed no
  missing files from the package view; the live tree only has extra metadata
  files and Synology `@eaDir` artifacts.
- That makes a plain "bad extraction" explanation unlikely for the current
  Driveclub black-screen hang.
| Xbox 360 emulation | Prefer Xenia Manager in its own Wine prefix so the manager and Canary stay in one place. Native/AUR Linux Xenia remains experimental. |
| 3DS AES keys | NOT in EmuDeck or any package. Must come from a real 3DS hardware dump. |
| Tokyo Night Kvantum theme | Does not exist. Closest Qt match is Catppuccin Mocha (blue accent). Tokyo Night GTK theme exists (`tokyonight-gtk-theme-git`). |
